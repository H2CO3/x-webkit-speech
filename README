Enables the x-webkit-speech attribute for MobileSafari using some JS and Obj-C
injection.

TODOs:
 - make a LaunchDaemon out of the server. For now, if you reboot the device,
   it halts.
 - Fix that nasty (not really bug, it is *expected* to work like this) behavior
   that repeats the speech recognition when the user presses "back" after a
   recognitinon session.
 - Make the speech recognition non-blocking, add a nice mike icon instead of
   the "Listen" button...
